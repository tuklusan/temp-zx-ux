"""The beeper for rvm: speaker edges -> PCM, WAV files, and host playback.

The machine logs every change of the beeper bit (port FEh bit 4) with its
T-state.  Rendering integrates the speaker level over each sample period
(3,500,000 / 44,100 T-states), so a tone's period is exactly the one the
Z80 code made: BEEP's frequency is the ROM's own, to the T-state.

Playback (the window) needs nothing outside Python's standard library.
The sound is one continuous stream, every frame's samples in order with
nothing between them: the Windows waveOut API (winmm, through ctypes), or
one paplay / aplay process fed raw samples through a pipe (Linux).  The
stream also keeps time: the machine thread hands it each frame and waits
while more than LATENCY seconds of sound are queued, so the emulated
Spectrum runs at the rate the sound card plays (50.08 frames a second)
and sound and picture stay together.  Without a stream (no sound device,
--mute, or macOS's afplay, which only plays files) a wall clock keeps the
same rate; afplay then gets the sound in short files, with gaps.

What is played goes through a DC blocker (as the Spectrum's own output
capacitor does), so a tone starting or stopping does not click; --wav
writes the exact, unfiltered samples.
