"""Public Z80 CPU API.

Implementation details are split across private instruction-family mixins. This
module remains the stable import surface for ``Z80CPU``, ``Flags``, and flag masks.

The host owns memory and every device: it passes ``read_byte(address)`` and
``write_byte(address, value)`` in, optionally ``read_port`` and ``write_port``
too, calls :meth:`Z80CPU.step`, and adds the returned T-states to its own
clock. See docs/start-here.md, "The embedding contract".
